This folder is used for saving resources, all the files except README.txt can be overwriten by creating same file at data dir.
For example, if you want to use your own ui.qss file, we intend data dir on your OS is /home/user/.local/share/AutoXuexiPlaywright, you can create file /home/user/.local/share/AutoXuexiPlaywright/resources/ui.qss.
Language file inside lang folder such as lang/zh-cn.json can also be overwriten by creating same file at data dir like /home/user/.local/share/AutoXuexiPlaywright/resources/lang/zh-cn.json.

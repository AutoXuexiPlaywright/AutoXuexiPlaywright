This folder is used for saving resources, all the files except README.txt can be overwriten by creating same file at core.DATA_DIR.
For example, if you want to use your own ui.qss file, we intend core.DATA_DIR on your OS is /home/user/.local/share/AutoXuexiPlaywright, you can create file /home/user/.local/share/AutoXuexiPlaywright/ui.qss.
Language file inside lang folder such as lang/zh-cn.json can also be overwriten by creating same file at core.DATA_DIR like /home/user/.local/share/AutoXuexiPlaywright/lang/zh-cn.json.
